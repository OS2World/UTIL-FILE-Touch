This version of touch was written for masm 5.1 using macros supplied.
The dynamic link library is written likewise. The argc and argv functions
are derived from examples given in "Advanced OS/2 Programming", by Ray
Duncan.

It is interesting that when using codeview, DosFindFirst fails, returning
12H (no matches). This happens under OS/2 V1.1 and V1.2.

I have not a copy of Microsoft's OS/2 Reference set, but the documentation
on DosOpen is sparse in Duncan's book. Overall though, it is a good book.

I now have the Lattice C Compiler 6.0, so I will be leaving an impression
of it on this board, soon. So far some sample code from Charles Petzold's
"Programming The OS/2 Presentation Manager" has worked perfectly. The
libraries included with the compiler package are impressive, indeed.
